- Three algorithms studied are presented in three different folders, naming: FIFO, RED and RRED

- Each algorithm has three paradigms of implementation: 1) Seqential 2) Parallel Using Barrier Synhcronization 3) Parallel Using Chandy Misra Bryant ALgo

- Codes has comments and are self explanatory. Furthermore, in the software/code impleentation section the detailed discription of the codes is provided.

- How to test the codes?
	Just run "python "name_of_file" " and that particular code will work.
	All the results are printed in ther terminal. If number of iterations requred are high then do change it in the last section of the code.
